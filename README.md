- **AI Writing Assistant**: Integrated AI helper for grammar correction, spelling fixes, and multilingual support
- **Easy Authentication**: Simple Google login integration
- **User-Friendly Workflow**: 
  - Login with Google
  - Create new resume from dashboard
  - Paste job description to extract relevant keywords
  - Build and optimize resume with AI assistance
  - Print-ready resume generation
